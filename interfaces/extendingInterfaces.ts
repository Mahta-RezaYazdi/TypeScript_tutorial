/**
 * TypeScript allows an interface to extend a class. 
 * In this case, the interface inherits the properties and methods of the class. 
 * Also, the interface can inherit the private and protected members of the class, not just the public members.
 * It means that when an interface extends a class with private or protected members, the interface can only be 
 * implemented by that class or subclasses of that class from which the interface extends.
 * 
 * By doing this, you restrict the usage of the interface to only class or subclasses of the class from which 
 * the interface extends. If you attempt to implement the interface from a class that is not a subclass of 
 * the class that the interface inherited, youâ€™ll get an error.
